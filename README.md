# Bayesian Obesity Diagnosis WebApp

Welcome! This WebApp uses Bayesian Networks to diagnose obesity after asking the user a few questions about their lifestyle. This github repo includes the code for the web but also the Jupyter notebooks to showcase how the Bayesian Network was created.

## Features of this repo

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Learn how to analyse data identifying between Obesity and user demographics!
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** - Learn how to prepare a dataset so it can be used for Algorithms to generate Bayesian Networks and make causal inferences!
- **Structural Learning Algorithms** - Learn about the algorithms that can create Bayesian Networks and understand how to evaluate them.
- **Causal Inference** - Learn how to make predictions with the Bayesian Network using the Python Library pyAgrum.
- **Counterfactual Modelling** - Learn how to do modelling to see the alternate outcomes of patients if they had made different lifestyle choices. 
- **Model Deployment and Monitoring** - Explore the code used for implementing the Network online for future predictions and how to connect user activity to a relational database and monitor the model.
